# Version : 0.4.0

# Version : 0.3.0

## New features
* A new function is created for synthetizing 2 deviations and 2 functions created to synthetize graphically the deviations 
(plot_bidev and plot_mst).  


## Minor changes
* mapmst does not produce cartography anymore (in order to be not dependant of the cartography package to map the results).
Now, the function output is a list of objects :
1 - A sf object, ordered according to the mst results (from 0 to 7)
2 - A vector giving recommended colors for mapping the results
3 - A vector giving an help to interpretation for mapping legend.
The function is renamed map_mst. 

* mst title function renamed "Multiscalar Typology (3 deviations)"

## Breaking changes
* The MTA package does not accept sp object anymore. Only sf objects.
