#' @title Spatial Deviation
#' @name sdev
#' @description Compute the deviation of each territorial unit as regards  
#' to its geographical neighborhood. Neighborhood is defined either
#' by contiguity order, by a distance value or by a personal matrix (travel time...) 
#' @param x a sf object including var1 and var2. 
#' @param var1 name of the numerator variable in x.
#' @param var2 name of the denominator variable in x.
#' @param order contiguity order.
#' @param dist distance threshold defining the contiguity. The cartesian 
#' distance between units centroids is used by default;
#'  use mat to apply different metrics.
#' @param xid identifier field in x (to be used for importing a personal distance matrix). 
#' Default to the first column of x. (optional) 
#' @param mat a distance matrix (road distance, travel time...) between x units. 
#' Row and column names must fit xid identifiers. (optional)
#' @param type type of deviation; "rel" for relative deviation, "abs" for 
#' absolute deviation (see Details).
#' @details 
#' The relative spatial deviation is the ratio between var1/var2 and 
#' var1/var2 in the specified neighborhood. Values greater than 100 indicate 
#' that the unit ratio is greater than the ratio in its neighborhood. Values 
#' lower than 100 indicate that the unit ratio is lower than the ratio in its 
#' neighborhood.\cr
#' The absolute spatial deviation is the amount of numerator that could be 
#' moved to obtain the same ratio in all units of its neighborhood. 
#' @return A vector is returned.
