\usage{
mapmst(x, var1, var2, ref, key, order, dist, mat, xid, threshold,
  superior = FALSE, colNA = "white", border = "grey80", lwd = 0.2,
  upborder = "black", uplwd = "1", add = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a sf object or a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame including var1 and var2.}

\item{var1}{name of the numerator variable in x.}

\item{var2}{name of the denominator variable in x.}

\item{ref}{ratio of reference; if NULL, the ratio of reference is the one of 
the whole study area (\code{sum(var1) / sum(var2)}).}

\item{key}{aggregation key field for measuring the deviation (intermediate territorial level).}

\item{order}{contiguity order.}

\item{dist}{distance threshold defining the contiguity. The cartesian 
distance between units centroids is used by default 
; use mat to apply different metrics.}

\item{mat}{a distance matrix (road distance, travel time...) between x units. 
Row and column names must fit xid identifiers. (optional)}

\item{xid}{identifier field in x (to be used for importing a personal distance matrix). Default to the first column.}

\item{threshold}{defined to build the typology (100 is considered as the average).}

\item{superior}{if TRUE, deviation values must be greater than threshold. If FALSE, 
deviation values must be lower than threshold.}

\item{colNA}{no data color}

\item{border}{color of the polygons border}

\item{lwd}{borders width}

\item{upborder}{color of the intermediate territorial level border}

\item{uplwd}{intermediate territorial level border width}

\item{add}{whether to add the layer to an existing plot (TRUE) or not (FALSE)}
}
\value{
A typology map with colours and a sf object including the ratio (var1/var2), the 3 relative 
deviations (G, T and S) and the resulting ordered typology (0 to 7). 
\itemize{Typology (which deviation is above/under the threshold):
\item{0: none}
\item{1: G }
\item{2: T}
\item{3: G and T}
\item{4: S}
\item{5: G and S}
\item{6: T and S}
\item{7: G, T and S}
}
}
\description{
Map the multiscalar typology according to the three relative 
deviations (general: G, territorial: T and spatial: S). The elementary units are classified
in eight classes according to their three relative positions and they are maped with appropriate colors.
