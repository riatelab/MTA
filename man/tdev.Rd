\title{Territorial Deviation}
\usage{
tdev(x, var1, var2, type = "rel", key)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data frame.}

\item{var1}{name of the numerator variable in x.}

\item{var2}{name of the denominator variable in x.}

\item{type}{type of deviation; "rel" for relative deviation, "abs" for 
absolute deviation (see Details).}

\item{key}{aggregation key field.}
}
\value{
A vector is returned.
}
\description{
This function computes the deviation between regional ratios 
and ratios of an aggregated level.
Each elementary unit's value will be compared to the value of the aggregated 
level it belongs to.
}
\details{
The relative territorial deviation is the ratio between var1/var2 and 
var1/var2 at the aggregated level. Values greater than 100 indicate that the 
unit ratio is greater than the ratio at the aggregated level. Values lower 
than 100 indicate that the unit ratio is lower than the ratio of the 
aggregated level.\cr
The absolute territorial deviation is the amount of numerator that could be 
moved to obtain the ratio of the aggregated level on all belonging units.
